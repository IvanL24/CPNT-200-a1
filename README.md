## Attributions
  - The in-class sample was very useful if by any chance that I am lost or forgot something.
  - the how to's very helpful in this kind of format, it is more easy to navigate my progress.

## Notes 
  - although its not php related, I am not satisfied with my footer like "why is it not staying at the bottom?" and sometimes "why is it not adapting to the height of `.container ` or `.legacy`?"
  - I enjoyed this assignment since it been a while since the last time we touched front-end.
